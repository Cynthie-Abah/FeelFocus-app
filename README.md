# FeelFocus app ðŸŒ¸

FeelFocus app is a pastel-themed, self-care app designed to blend intentional productivity with emotional awareness. Built with a strong emphasis on user experience, it features focus sessions, affirmations, mood tracking, and optional ambient music to help users get things done â€” gently.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This
Productivity tools often feel harsh or clinical. I wanted to explore how soft visual design, emotional UX, and lightweight tech could make focus more inviting, especially for people who feel overwhelmed by traditional tools.
